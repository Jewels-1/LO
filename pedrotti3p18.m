P = (1000)*pi*(2.5/100)^2 %Watts = (W/m^2)*(m^2)

%For an image at infinity, the image is produce at the focal length of the
%thin lens and in the paraxial approximation has an image height
%(theta/2)*f

A = pi*((0.25*pi/180)*50/100)^2 %m^2

Irradiance = (P/A) *(1/100)^2 %W/cm^2 = (W/m^2)*(1 m /100 cm)^2

%It looks like the units are incorrect in the back of the book or that a
%calculation mistake was made by the author
%verified that the irradiance of the sun at earth surface can be
%approximately 1000 W/m^2
